### create <a name="create"></a>
Create customer balance refund

<p>When you create a new refund, you must specify a Charge or a PaymentIntent object on which to create it.</p>

<p>Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been created but not yet refunded.
Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally charged.</p>

<p>You can optionally refund only part of a charge.
You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been refunded.</p>

<p>Once entirely refunded, a charge can’t be refunded again.
This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded charge,
or when trying to refund more money than is left on a charge.</p>

**API Endpoint**: `POST /v1/refunds`

#### Example Snippet

```typescript
import Stripe from "@sideko-inc/stripe";

const client = new Stripe({
  username: process.env["API_USERNAME"]!!,
  password: process.env["API_PASSWORD"]!!,
  token: process.env["API_TOKEN"]!!,
});
const res = await client.refund.create();
```

### update <a name="update"></a>
