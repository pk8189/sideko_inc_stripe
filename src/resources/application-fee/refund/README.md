### create <a name="create"></a>
Create an application fee refund

<p>Refunds an application fee that has previously been collected but not yet refunded.
Funds will be refunded to the Stripe account from which the fee was originally collected.</p>

<p>You can optionally refund only part of an application fee.
You can do so multiple times, until the entire fee has been refunded.</p>

<p>Once entirely refunded, an application fee can’t be refunded again.
This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded application fee,
or when trying to refund more money than is left on an application fee.</p>

import Stripe from "@sideko-inc/stripe";

const client = new Stripe({

  password: process.env["API_PASSWORD"]!!,
  token: process.env["API_TOKEN"]!!,
});
const res = await client.applicationFee.refund.create({ id: "string" });
```
