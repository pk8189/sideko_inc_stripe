As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> value passed in the request. </p>
